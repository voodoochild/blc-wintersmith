I ended up stuck on a long train journey this weekend and passed the time chatting with a fellow player about some potential small quality–of–life changes. I’d love to hear your thoughts and ideas on what minor changes could make your play time more enjoyable.

- **Item quality outlines**<br>
It’s been suggested and mocked up time and time again, but having some kind of item quality colouring is almost certainly my number one request. For such a relatively straight forward (the feature, not necessarily the implementation) UI tweak, I think that it would make it much easier to see at a glance what you had equipped or in your bags.

- **Inventory sort options**<br>
I’d like some ability to have items automatically sorted as they go into my bags. We already have this to some degree by using specific bags to capture specific items, i.e. trash, armour, crafting, but I’d like an inventory–wide option to order items by quality. It’s easy to run out of space when dungeon running, or zerging around a champion farm or in WvW, and having all of my white/green/blue items in a row for easy salvaging would be a real time–saver.

- **Bag icons shows remaining empty slots**<br>
Wow, this seems pretty inventory–heavy so far. The bag icon turns red when your bags are all full, but how about if it actually showed you the exact number of inventory slots that you had left to fill? It might help you plan a timely vendor break to offload.

- **Better achievement granularity**<br>
Both [Krait Bane][0] and [Toxic Global Gardener][1] in the current living world patch are good examples of this problem: trying to keep track of which parts of a multi–part achievement you’ve already completed. <q>1/3 Krait Champions Killed</q> — *which one?* <q>4/5 Maps Cleared of Toxic Offshoots</q> — *where have I missed?* ArenaNet may have good reason to obfuscate this information, but I would really like a breakdown to be included in the achievement tooltip.

- **Warning before using an inadequate gathering tool**<br>
Keeping track of what gathering tools I have equipped across multiple characters and matching that to what materials I can collect in each zone is boring. I don’t want to give up precious bag space to carry various quality tools, and I don’t want to feel like I need to buy the unlimited gem store versions. Adding a little warning icon overlaid on the gathering node which indicates whether or not the tool I have equipped is good enough (or maybe too good?) would be a nice touch.
